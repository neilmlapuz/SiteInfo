# Data Exploration
This part of the project consists of exploring the dataset that I will be using to train my Neural Network. Along with the file, the source code for this is also available in the same directory.

### Total Images
First letâ€™s inspect the number of images, as you can see there are **1225029** rows in our dataset.

### Data Glimpse
Having a glimpse of the data that we will be using, the set has three columns, first being an id for the image, the second would be the link/url for the image and the third would be the landmark id for the image.

There are 14951 unique landmark_id data. All id's and url's are unique.

### Frequent LandmarkID
The following then shows the most frequent landmarks in our dataset.
